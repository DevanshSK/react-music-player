## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this project I learned a lot of things in React.
Some of them are as follows:

1. How to create and deploy a react app from scratch.
2. Learned the Implementation of useState, useEffect and useRef hooks.
3. Learned about bug fixing process in applications, as there were a lot of bugs encountered during development.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to add a backend and a database to the application such that we can add more songs to the music player easily.
